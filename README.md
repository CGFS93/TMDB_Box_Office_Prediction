# Topic: TMDB Box Office Prediction

## Reason the topic was selected:
- A topic revolving movies was selected because it is a fun topic that everyone can relate to. Who knows, maybe after this analysis, we will get inspired to produce our own movie by mimicking the features of other movies in order to achieve the same revenue.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to look over the metadata on over 3000 past films from The Movie Database to try and predict their overall worldwide box office revenue.

## Questions the team hopes to answer with the data:
- How does budget influence revenue?
- What is the average revenue for each genre
    - Are there genres that have higher revenues than others?
- Of those that had a homepage, what did their revenue look like in comparison to those that didnâ€™t have a home page?
- Did production companies have a major influence on revenue?
- Which production company had the highest average revenue?
- Release date vs inflation rate at the time the movie was released?
    - Adjusted revenue after inflation is considered?
        - This would probably require another dataset with inflation rate history?
- What was the average revenue per cast and crew member per movie
